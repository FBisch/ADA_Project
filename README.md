# Food throughout countries: are our food habits conditioned by our living location?

# Data Story
You will find our entire data story on: https://openfactfoodada.github.io/, you will acces on the different part of the project by cliking on the three questions at the end of the page.

You can also have acces directly to the different parts:

-Which countries have the healthiest alimentation?:

-Are the differences in the composition of a given product in different countries?:

-Which countries consume more locally?:

# Abstract
We often hear stereotypes about food in the countries: “USA food contains more sugar and fat than elsewhere”, “Quantities are more important in the USA”, “Swiss people like to consume more local products than elsewhere”. How true are these stereotypes? That’s what we wanted to verify.

In appearance globalization is getting stronger, but regarding food, shouldn’t we use the term ‘glocalisation’ instead? The term glocalisation would suggest a local adaptation of global products depending on consumer’s tastes. Indeed, even though in appearance we find almost the same products in supermarkets all around the world, are they ‘really’ the same? We know, for example, that the ‘same’ coca-cola bottle contains actually more sugar in America than in France. We wanted to know if such phenomenon is common and what are the main differences between the countries. 
The Nutrition grade (from A to E) indicates how ‘good’ a given product is (more fibres, less sugar or salt, etc) and the ‘Nova group’ (from 1 to 4) indicates how transformed a product is. Those grades as well as the origin of the products, their composition and the types of packaging (eco-friendly or not) would be interesting to compare between different countries but also, eventually, in a given country between different brands.


# Research questions
Which countries have the healthiest alimentation?

What are the differences in the composition of a given product in different countries? (ex: Coca-cola, Nutella…)

Are some ingredients/nutriments/products notably more used in some countries?

Which countries consume more locally?


# Dataset
Open food fact database : https://world.openfoodfacts.org

It is a CSV file of 1.6GB, not ‘very’ big, but big enough to be able to respond to numerous questions.
The test file describing it is pretty clear. (https://static.openfoodfacts.org/data/data-fields.txt)
We can also download smaller csv files from the website for a given country or a given product, if we want to deal with smaller dataset for specific questions.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
Define which countries we want to use for the comparison: we need to find countries with enough data available on the website to do a robust data analysis, and select the most relevant/interesting countries we want to focus on.

Define precisely which data from the dataset we want to use, including the sub-datasets present on the website.

Do the data cleaning.

Explore the different possibilities for the data visualization.

# Questions for TAa
Is the idea fitting to the theme ‘data science for social good’?

Is it necessary to use Spark for this project ?

Do you think our project is too ambitious ? Not ambitious enough ?
